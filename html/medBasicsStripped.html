				<h2>Prescription Drugs</h2>

				<h2>Giving Medications</h2>
				<p>Medications are meant to be taken at very specific times. A timing mistake can be very serious. It can lead to an overdose or to poor treatment. As a direct support professional, there are three kinds of timing you need to know about</p>
				<h4>Time-Limited Medications</h4>
				<p>Often given to treat an illness or a temporary condition. An example is strep throat. These are often given in the smallest dose possible. You should never skip a dose. It is important to take these on time. It is also important to take the full amount of medication. Not doing this can reduce a medication’s effectiveness.</p>
				<h4>On-Going Medications</h4>
				<p>These are taken regularly. They are taken in a routine way. An example is medicine for diabetes or blood pressure. It is important to develop a system. This helps to give these in the right way at the right time. Always check the label. Always make sure no changes have been made.</p>
				<h4>As Needed Medications</h4>
				<p>These are often called PRNs. A PRN may be an extra dose of a regular medication. Or it may be a separate prescription. It may also be an over-the-counter medication. PRNs meet a specific need. An example is medication for a head or a stomach ache. It could also help with a change in a chronic condition like blood pressure. PRN medications need to be given with the same care as on-going medications.</p>
